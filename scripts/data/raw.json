This allows you to extend the use of your existing hardware investment without needing to buy extra PoE switches.Furthermore, non-PoE devices like wireless access points can also be powered up remotely by adding additional PoE splitters, since power and data are further split into two cables. These devices can therefore be installed in hard-to-reach areas like ceilings where there are no outlets or electrical wiring nearby.",

We all know the struggle of managing so many devices with different interfaces and communication protocols.. You keep adding new solutions to your setup to keep up, but the older devices are still too good to let them go. How do you integrate all of them in a single system that will serve you right? Easy – you “tie” them together by using the KNOT!\n\nIt doesn’t matter whether you have devices that are no longer in production, devices that came out this year, or even some custom solutions by your technician – the KNOT can handle them all!\n\nKNOT LR8/LR9 kit is an out-of-the-box IoT Gateway solution for LoRa® technology. It uses Narrow Band and CAT-M technology. Because of the low cost, low bandwidth cellular connection, it is supported by countless mobile operators around the globe. This kit contains a pre-installed UDP packet forwarder to any public or private LoRa® servers. With the support of 8 different channels, Listen Before Talk (LBT) and spectral scan features this product will astound you with its enticing price point.\n\nIt could be used as a backup connection for the Ethernet or as a management channel for your network. NB/CAT-M monthly plan is much cheaper than LTE. Why spend extra money on bandwidth you don’t need? For example, you can manage a KNOT-powered vending machine with temperature and moisture sensors with only a few megabytes per day!",

This is a must-have these days! You can use the 2.4 GHz channel for older devices and the 5 GHz channel for everything else since this frequency is less cluttered.\n\nThe wAP ac is weatherproof and can be fixed to any external wall from the inside of the case – for extra security and less visible attachments. The bottom part can also be secured with a special anti-vandal screw, which can only be opened by the owner.\n\nThere is an opening in the back of the case, allowing you to run the Ethernet cable directly behind the unit and through the wall. This way the wAP ac attracts less attention and blends into any environment.It looks unobtrusive and sleek, available in two colors - black (RBwAPG-5HacD2HnD-BE) and white (RBwAPG-5HacD2HnD).",

  "desc": "The ceiling AP on steroids! Mikrotik bestseller cAP is back – juiced up and stronger than ever. Compared to the previous cAP models, the improved high-gain antenna increases the covered area by up to 100%! Need a nice-looking access point that won’t get in your way? Or perhaps you’re managing the network in a crowded place and don’t want everyone to have physical access to the device? Either way – ceiling is the answer! The device itself is pretty sleek - the low profile attracts less attention than a smoke detector. Your clients, guests, or colleagues won’t even notice it. But they will definitely notice the blazing fast wireless connection all across the premises. The new design features a larger high-gain antenna, higher sensitivity, and a built-in reflector. These improvements allow increasing the covered area by up to 100%, compared to the previous cAP models! The dual-band, dual-chain 2.4 and 5 GHz wireless radio provides a strong coverage in 360 degrees around it, so you don’t have to worry about the placement of the device so much. Putting it on the ceiling eliminates many signal absorption problems, such as the signal being blocked by large TV sets, metal cubicle walls in open space offices, etc. Even though the radio supports repeater mode, the two Gigabit Ethernet ports give you the ability to extend your network with cables, even if PoE power is required: the cAP XL ac supports 802.3af/at PoE input on the first port and passive PoE output (up to 57V) on the second port.",

  "overview": "If you are managing networks in a large, busy area (like a park or a stadium), then you have probably experienced all kinds of problems – massive interference, signal loss during bad weather, etc. And laying wires everywhere can be clumsy and expensive, sometimes even impossible. Finally, there is a simple, secure and extremely cost-effective solution: the Wireless Wire Cube. It is a kit of two pre-paired devices that form a blazing fast AES encrypted wireless connection. Pure plug-and-play: just point the Cubes at one another and power them on! The 60 GHz frequency is unaffected by the crowded wireless spectrum, it offers high speed and capacity. Traditional 60 GHz devices, however, can have limited connectivity during bad weather. But not the Wireless Wire Cube! It features an automatic 5 GHz backup connection, so you don’t have to worry about any downtime. No need for additional configuration - the 5 GHz backup connection works out-of-the-box! The Cube will take care of your connection at all times. It can easily cover a distance of 800 meters and reach fiber-like speed. The Сube form-factor has been designed with function and durability in mind. And it attracts less unwanted attention due to its size and shape. The box includes two Cube 60G ac devices that are already paired together, power supplies, PoE injectors and mounting kits for both devices.",

Perfect for industrial telemetry systems or to track all kinds of heavy equipment and materials at a construction site.\n\nLike the indoor version, this tag also supports iBeacon, Eddystone, and MikroTik telemetry formats. There is an NFC encoded MAC address and optional encryption. Unlike the indoor version, the outdoor tag comes with a built-in temperature sensor that can be used for condition monitoring. The ±0.5°C precision can be very useful in cold supply chain logistics.\n\nTG-BT5-OUT features an improved 550 mAH battery that will last around five years (with a sending interval of 1s). It is suitable for strapping to all kinds of surfaces, and it can handle a temperature range of -20°C to 85°C.",

  "overview": "\n\nFeaturing two 3x3 MIMO radios that can support up to 450 and 1300 Mbps data rates in the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands respectively, the ECW5210-L is ideal for providing wire-like performance that is crucial for businesses. Traffic prioritization ensures that bandwidth hungry applications such as 4K videos can stream perfectly, while enforcing strict quality of service requirements for VoIP and mission critical services.\n\nGiven the overcrowding of the 2.4 GHz band by legacy Wi-Fi devices, more and more devices and networks are migrating to the 5 GHz band for increased performance. The wider channels and additional spatial streams offered by 802.11ac allows the ECW5210-L to meet high capacity demands while providing three-fold performance over 802.11n networks. However, due to the significant proportion of 2.4 GHz-only clients in use today, the ECW5210-L’s ability to service clients in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands becomes essential for organizations that wish to improve overall wireless experience without sacrificing legacy support.\n\nThe ECW5210-L’s exterior is composed of a UL94-5VB rated, pearl-white plastic front panel and a metallic back plate – a simplistic and elegant design that is perfect for blending into everyday public or working environments. Furthermore, the camouflaged appearance of the ECW5210-L is accentuated by its six internal antennas, which serve to amplify wireless coverage. With two different mounting mechanisms, the ECW5210-L can be easily mounted on walls or ceilings. Combined with PoE (Power over Ethernet) support that eliminates the need for traditional power sources, the ECW5210-L offers unparalleled deployment flexibility.\n\nWhen used with the Edgecore EWS Controller, the ECW5210-L supports a wide-array of value added applications required by enterprises and organizations, such as bandwidth control, user authentication and billing, centralized WLAN management, and much more. Along with stringent yet customizable security policies, the flexible and fully-featured ECW5210-L becomes the ideal choice for all types of businesses, from small coffee shops to large corporations.\n",

  "overview": "The Edgecore ECS4120-28P switch is a Gigabit Ethernet PoE access switch with four 10G uplink ports. The switch is ideal for SMB, enterprise, and campus networks to connect power devices such as VoIP phones, wireless access points, surveillance cameras etc. PoE enables both power and data to be transferred over existing Cat. 5 cables, eliminating the need for individual power sources for devices in the network and saving on costs for power cables. The ECS4120-28P switch is packed with features that bring high availability, comprehensive security, robust multicast control, and advance QoS to the network edge, while maintaining simple management. The switch also supports the most advance IPv6 management, IPv6 security, and IPv6 multicast control in accordance with the growth of IPv6 deployment.",
  "features": "\nFeatures\n\n    Comprehensive QoS - The ECS4120-28P offers advanced QoS for marking, classification, and scheduling to deliver best-in-class performance for data, voice, and video traffic at wire speed.\n    Robust Multicast Control - IGMP snooping prevents the flooding of multicast traffic by dynamically configuring switch ports so that multicast traffic is forwarded to only those ports associated with an IP multicast receiver.\n    Private VLANs and Multicast VLAN Registration - Multicast VLANs are shared in the network, while subscribers remain in separate VLANs.\n    IPv6 Support - The switch supports a number of IPv6 features, including IPv6 Management, DHCPv6 Snooping with Option 37, IPv6 Source Guide, and MVR6.\n    Service Monitoring and Management - The ECS4120-28P supports IEEE 802.1ag and ITU-T Y.1731, allowing service providers to monitor end-to-end services, identify connectivity and performance issues, and isolate problems from a remote location without dispatching an engineer onsite.\n    Superior Management - An industry-standard command-line interface (CLI), accessed through the console port or Telnet, provides a familiar user interface and command set for users to manage the switch.\n    Virtual Private Networks - The ECS4120-28P supports Layer 2 VPNs by using Q-in-Q functions, where an 802.1Q tag from a customer VLAN (called CE-VLAN ID) is encapsulated in a second 802.1Q tag from a service-provider network (called an SP-VLAN ID).\n    The ECS4120-28P can provide up to 30 Watts of power to attached devices, such as VoIP phones, wireless access points, and surveillance cameras etc, all over existing Cat. 5 cables. The PoE Power Budget is 370W.\n\n",

POS-4001 is an outdoor PoE Splitter that adds PoE functionality to any network device requiring high power.POS-4001 is enclosed in a durable IP66-rated outdoor waterproof housing for long-lasting performance in tough conditions.When used in a Power over Ethernet network, POS-4001 takes the power sent over the Cat.5 cable from the PSE (Power Sourcing Equipment) and delivers it to the non-PoE network device for easy and flexible installation. Internal current limit, short-circuit and overload protection are implemented to provide up to DC 12V/2.5A.POS-4001 can also work together with LevelOne's high-power PoE injector, POI-4000. This can extend Ethernet connectivity an additional 100 meters for high power PD devices, such as IP network cameras, wireless access points, VoIP phones or other devices that require power greater than 15.4 W.",

  "overview": "If you need to connect multiple devices – take a look at the CubeSA 60Pro ac sector antenna. Reaching distances around 600 meters in point-to-multipoint mode, this device can be very helpful for all kinds of event management: from live shows, festivals, and workshops to construction sites, pop-up vaccination clinics, and so on. No need for complex wired installations in every location – the portable and handy\nCubeSA 60Pro ac has got you covered! Depending on your setup, the distance can be even greater. For example, with devices like MikroTik nRAY, you can reach up to 800 meters.\n\nForget about downtime with the automatic 5 GHz backup connection The 60 GHz frequency is unaffected by the crowded wireless spectrum, it offers high speed and capacity. But it can sometimes struggle during bad weather conditions. That’s why both Cube 60Pro devices feature an automatic 5 GHz failover. We have added a powerful directional antenna so that the 5 GHz range can keep up with the 60 GHz.\nMore durability, less unwanted attention We have upgraded the enclosure to feature a strong metal base – for better mounting and cooling options. The Cube form-factor emerges from pure practicality: it is durable, unobtrusive, and compact.",

  "overview": "MikroTik RouterBOARD C52iG-5HaxD2HaxD-TC-US (US Version) hAP ax² (WiFi6) Quad-Core IPQ-6010 864 MHz, RAM 1GB, RouterOS, License level 4 It’s time to supercharge your home network with the Generation 6 wireless network and our latest addition to the beloved hAP series. hAP ax² has everything you might need in a primary home access point – and more. Forget endless reviews and comparisons – this is the perfect device for 99% of homes. Wireless signal is now stronger than ever. Here are the two main ingredients of hAP ax’s success: a state-of-the-art dual-band, dual-chain 4-4.5 dBi radio, and the 802.11ax standard with Wave2 support. Let’s compare it to the previous generation: depending on your overall setup, that means up to 40% higher speed in the 5 GHz and up to 90% higher speed in the 2.4 GHz spectrum. Some might ask – why do we even need higher wireless speeds? Well, countless use cases have been previously impossible or difficult to pull off. For example, working with large media files over the wireless network – without the need to download and upload everything. Do you really have the time to wait? Grab a hAP ax² and save more time for the essential things in life. The modern quad-core CPU running at 864 MHz combined with a solid GB of RAM packs a hefty punch when it comes to heavy operations like complex firewall rules, IPsec hardware encryption, using more threads or experimenting with the most advanced RouterOS features. And with the addition of WPA3 advanced encryption support, you’re safer than ever before. Like the previous models, hAP ax² can be mounted vertically, horizontally, or even on the wall – without sacrificing the strong signal. With so many products and features on the market, even an experienced user can become confused. So it’s time for a simple truth for a simple choice: you can’t go wrong with a hAP ax² in most homes.

  "overview": "Long gone are the days when you had to rely on cables for speed and stability. 60 GHz solutions offer fiber-like speed and stability - while saving you plenty of time and money on installation and maintenance. Our latest Cube 60Pro product line is taking the advantages of 60 GHz networking to the next level – with the 802.11ay standard for even higher distances, stability, speed, and convenience. \n\nThe Cube 60Pro ac CPE allows you to establish ultra-fast point-to-point connections over distances as far as 1 km. And that’s not all – we have added Channel 5* support, so you can reach even higher distances if necessary. In our tests, the Cube 60Pro ac easily maintained a reliable connection over 2.4 km. Bridging two locations has never been easier!\n\nForget about downtime with the automatic 5 GHz backup connection The 60 GHz frequency is unaffected by the crowded wireless spectrum, it offers high speed and capacity. But it can sometimes struggle during bad weather conditions. That’s why both Cube 60Pro devices feature an automatic 5 GHz failover. We have added a powerful directional antenna so that the 5 GHz range can keep up with the 60 GHz.\nMore durability, less unwanted attention We have upgraded the enclosure to feature a strong metal base – for better mounting and cooling options. The Cube form-factor emerges from pure practicality: it is durable, unobtrusive, and compact.",

  "overview": "Bluetooth tags play a huge role in IoT setups, where Bluetooth is used to broadcast the data over short distances. You can use these small devices for proximity-based tracking of various objects. For example, if you have a KNOT gateway in different parts of a construction site, you can use these tags to locate construction tools, electrical equipment, and other assets.\n\nJust attach the tags to the necessary items - and the nearest gateway will sense the tags in its proximity. Exceptionally useful in warehouse logistics – let your cargo inform you as soon as it enters the warehouse! They use so little power that a single built-in 220 mAh battery will last for years.\n\nOnce activated, the tag will broadcast iBeacon, Eddystone or MikroTik telemetry advertising packets to the gateway (such as the KNOT or any other BLE gateway). These packets contain MAC address used for ID, as well as telemetry data – such as acceleration, tilt and battery charge level. The gateway then pushes the data to the remote server utilizing MQTT or HTTP protocols. By default, advertisement packets are sent once every 5 seconds, but you can change this value to your liking. For example, if you set the interval to 1 second, the battery will typically last two years. The built-in accelerometers can not only detect acceleration (movement), but can also register if the device was dropped or tilted (free-fall detection). The indoor version of our BLE tags works best in a temperature range from 0°C to 70°C. It is splash-proof, and comes with a built-in accelerometer.",

The device consumes up to 44 W leaving guaranteed 450 W (3x150 W per every 8 Ethernet ports) to power your PoE devices. Each port can provide up to 30 W of power with any power output option you choose.\n\nThe device has a “Dual boot” feature that allows you to choose between two operating systems - RouterOS or SwOS. If you prefer to have a simplified operating system with only switch specific features, use SwOS. If you would like the ability to use routing and other Layer 3 features in your CRS, use RouterOS. You can select the desired operating system from RouterOS, from SwOS or from the RouterBOOT loader settings. All the feature set comes with disruptive price, providing best price/performance on the market.",

You’re getting the modern ARM v7 CPU, 256 MB of RAM, and better cooling. The new Marvell switch-chips bring phenomenal performance to the table! The Gigabit Ethernet port has a direct connection to the switch chip – so you can enjoy full gigabit speed there. And it supports PoE-in, giving you an additional powering option in tricky spots. You can mount this switch in a standard 1U rack to keep everything organized. And it has all the power you would expect from a rackmount device: CRS310 supports hardware offloaded VLAN- filtering. And even some hardware offloaded Layer-3 routing. CRS310-1G-5S-4S+IN is a fantastic tool for anyone working with indoor connections over 100 meters while keeping data loss and ping low. Optical fiber can be a great alternative to copper if you are worried about electromagnetic interference, tampering or eavesdropping.",

  "overview": "This unique module opens up a whole world of high speed connectivity possibilities, offering up to 10 Gbps speeds over regular familiar twisted-pair cables in your existing products that have SFP+ ports. Any MikroTik device with active cooling that has SFP+ ports can now be used without installing any optical fiber, just plug the S+RJ10 and your network can be upgraded to 10 Gbps, making it ready for the next generation of RJ45 hardware. S+RJ10 module is supported also on devices with passive cooling, but may require an extra cooling. New revision of S+RJ10 comes with several improvements: - Jumbo frames up to 10218 Bytes are now supported; - Link speed reporting is fixed - actual link speed in the interface menu is listed. Previously 100M/1G/2.5G/5G link speeds were not reported correctly; - DDM monitoring (Supply Voltage, Module temperature) is now supported.",
